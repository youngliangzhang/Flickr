# Flickr

Project description:
 This project is for getting images from Flickr and showing them by using Flickr api.
 User can load more images by scroll down and he can see detail when he click image.
 This project is using Retrofit for calling rest api and Gson for parsing JSON.
 Picasso is used for loading network image.
 Also ConstraintLayout is used for UI so that we can reduce view hierarchy depth
 
 I tired to implement OOP and MVC here, too.

I will use android architecture libraries such as ViewModel, DAO, LifeCycle and Dagger2 for dependency injection when continuing develop project.
For current, there is no case for using those libraries.

External Libraries:
 Network library: Retrofit with OkHttp
 ImageLoading Library: Picasso
 Ui injection library: Butterknife
